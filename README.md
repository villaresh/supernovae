This repository shows all the codes and sources used to carry out a research projects titled as follows: "Analysing Type Ia Supernovae Redshift Measurements for Dark Energy Quantification". 
This study aims to quantify the dark energy in the Universe from Hubble Space Telescope raw redshift data. Measuring the effective magnitude for several type Ia Supernovae we demonstrated that there is some energy, whose essential nature remains unknown, that composes about 75% of the cosmos.

In essence, it consists on going deeply in the understanding of the discovery that led Adam Riess (astrophysicist and Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute), Saul Perlmutter (astrophysicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley) and Brian Schmidt (Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University) to win the Physics Nobel Prize in 2011.

The data used for the Supernovae plots is extracted from S. Perlmutter et al. (1998). Measurements of Omega and Lambda from 42 High- Redshift Supernovae. The Astrophysical Journal, 517(2), 565â€“586.

# Analysing Type Ia Supernovae Redshift Measurements for Dark Energy Quantification
## 1. Introduction
The aim is to use redshift measurements and the effective magnitude for several Type Ia Supernovae data to quantify how much dark energy is in the Universe.
## 2. Materials and methods
Firstly, we need a model for the distance of a supernovae at a given redshift. Type Ia supernovae result from the violent explosion of a white dwarf star. Every SNIa shown was equally bright (same luminosity L).
Consequently, flux f is, in this particular case, equivalent to distance according to the inverse-square law.
Light is emitted when an electron transitions between any two levels with a wavelength given by the Rydberg formula.
If the hydrogen exists in a galaxy that is moving, we see the lines Doppler shifted (v = cz).
##  3. Results and discussion
Since we are using standard candles, we directly use effective magnitude to not have to convert our data to distance.

Even by eye, the data apparenty prefers some dark energy. Nevertheless, there is not a huge amount in it.
