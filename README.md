# Supernovae
This repository shows all the codes and sources used to carry out a research projects titled as follows: "Analysing Type Ia Supernovae Redshift Measurements for Dark Energy Quantification". 
This study aims to quantify the dark energy in the Universe from Hubble Space Telescope raw redshift data. Measuring the effective magnitude for several type Ia Supernovae we demonstrated that there is some energy, whose essential nature remains unknown, that composes about 75% of the cosmos.

In essence, it consists on going deeply in the understanding of the discovery that led Adam Riess (astrophysicist and Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute), Saul Perlmutter (astrophysicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley) and Brian Schmidt (Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University) to win the Phyisics Nobel Prize in 2011.

The data used for the Supernovae plots is extracted from S. Perlmutter et al. (1998). Measurements of Omega and Lambda from 42 High- Redshift Supernovae. The Astrophysical Journal, 517(2), 565â€“586.
